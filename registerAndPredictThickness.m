% Inputs:

% maxNumPatches - maximum number of small patches per image to be
% considered

% Outputs:

% It could be difficult for two large consecutive serial section images
% to be globally registered properly. However, smaller regions of both
% images could be registered more effectively. Since the distance measure
% between images is based on correlation of coefficient (or related), such
% problems will introduce an unnecessary distance between two adjacent
% images. Therefore, for a given pair of images, we first register smaller
% sub-pairs of images and calculate the distance between each such pair and
% then take the median (to be robust against outliers)

% NB: If the image patches are  too small it will negatively affect the
% thickness estimate. If the image patches are too large, the patch registration
% process will not be effective.
