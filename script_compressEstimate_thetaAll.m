% main script to create compression estimates \gamma_{yx} for different
% rotated versions of the original image stack
% rotations \theta = [0,10,90]

% read image stack and rotate by t
% extract cubic block with horizontal x axis (rotated axis)

% create and save gp models for new x and y axis

% create inputs stacks of shifted images

% run distance (thickness) estimator to predict \gamma_{yx}
